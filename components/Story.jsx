          Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat surgically. 
          With <span className="font-semibold text-purple-700">PRISM</span>, we aim to empower surgeons and radiologists with 
          real-time assistance during both the pre-operative and intra-operative phases 
          of surgery. From automatic CT scan segmentation to AI-assisted organ detection 
          in mixed reality, PRISM is designed to reduce surgical complications by up to 
          <span className="font-semibold text-green-600"> 30%</span> and bring modern, accessible innovation to the operating room â€” 
          all at a low cost.
