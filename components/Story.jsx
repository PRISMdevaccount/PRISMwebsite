      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto">
        Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat surgically. 
        With PRISM, we aim to empower surgeons and radiologists with real-time assistance 
        during both the pre-operative and intra-operative phases of surgery. From 
        automatic CT scan segmentation to AI-assisted organ detection in mixed reality, 
        PRISM is designed to reduce surgical complications by up to 30% and bring modern, 
        accessible innovation to the operating room â€” all at a low cost.
