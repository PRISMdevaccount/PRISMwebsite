# How PRISM Came to Life

The story of PRISM begins with a simple question:  
**What if surgeons had a digital assistant that could “see” what they see—  
and help them make safer, faster decisions during pancreatic surgery?**

## 💡 The Spark

Pancreatic surgery is one of the most complex and high-risk operations.  
During early research, our team kept hearing the same frustrations from surgeons:  
- Long operation times.  
- Difficulty identifying critical vessels.  
- Limited visualization of hidden structures.  

We realized that if **AI could work alongside the surgeon**—not replace them—it could reduce uncertainty and improve outcomes.

## 🛠️ From Idea to Prototype

The journey from an idea scribbled on a whiteboard to an actual product was anything but smooth.  

- **Phase 1 – Research:** We began by studying thousands of CT scans, training algorithms to recognize the pancreas and surrounding anatomy.  
- **Phase 2 – Prototype:** Using Unity and AR headsets, we built the first version of PRISM: a tool that overlays 3D models on top of real surgical images.  
- **Phase 3 – Iteration:** Early demos were clunky. The headset felt heavy, the software lagged, and accuracy was far from perfect. But with each test, we refined PRISM closer to what it is today.

## 🌍 The Human Side

PRISM isn’t just about technology—it’s about **patients**.  
Behind every dataset is a real person waiting for a surgery that could change their life.  
This reminder kept us pushing forward, even during late-night coding sessions and frustrating failed experiments.  

One surgeon told us:  
> “If PRISM can save me even five minutes in the operating room, that’s five minutes less anesthesia for my patient—and that’s priceless.”

## 🚀 Where We’re Headed

Today, PRISM is more than just a prototype.  
It’s a growing platform, expanding into:  
- **AI-guided planning tools** for surgeons.  
- **Immersive visualization** for radiologists.  
- **Educational modules** for training medical students.  

We’re just getting started.  
PRISM was born from curiosity, built with persistence, and will grow with the vision of making pancreatic surgery safer for everyone.
